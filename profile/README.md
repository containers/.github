# Welcome to Containers! 
We're a collection of open source tools that create, configure, and work with containers.

## 🛠️ Tools
Some of our tools include [Podman](https://github.com/containers/podman), [Buildah](https://github.com/containers/buildah), [Skopeo](https://github.com/containers/skopeo), [conmon-rs](https://github.com/containers/conmon-rs), [crun](https://github.com/containers/crun), [Podman Desktop](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop) and [youki](https://github.com/containers/youki), just to name a few. We also have several supporting libraries for these tools, such as [common](https://github.com/containers/common), [storage](https://github.com/containers/storage), [image](https://github.com/containers/image), and more. Check them out and see all the cool things happening!

## 🤝 Community
We have an active community. Most of our community communication channels are around [Podman](https://github.com/containers/podman), but we definitely welcome anyone with an interest in containers or any of our tools.

Maintainers of Containers and other community members generally chat here:
- IRC: #podman on [libera.chat](https://libera.chat/)
- Matrix: [#podman:matrix.org](https://matrix.to/#/#podman:fedoraproject.org)
- Discord: [Podman](https://discord.com/invite/x5GzFF6QH4)

The Matrix room has been bridged with the Discord server and the libera.chat channel so joining one should be sufficient.

We hold also [community meetings](https://podman.io/community/#community-meetings) around once a month and have a [mailing list](https://podman.io/community/#mailing-list) for additional discussion.
